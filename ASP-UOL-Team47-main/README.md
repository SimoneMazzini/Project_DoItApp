**Running and working on the app**

**This was developed in Visual Studio Code. I don't know how the set up is like in other IDEs so I can't help there.
- Clone the repo
- Open the terminal and navigate to doitApp directory: `cd doitApp`
- install all dependencies:  `npm install`
- You can run the app by typing: `nodemon doitApp` --> (You won't need to refresh the server constantly after this to view changes, just refresh the browser).

- Create a branch if you're going to work on something, then merge your changes when you're done and nothing brakes the rest of the application.

Thanks.

**Database create function has been added on the app**
